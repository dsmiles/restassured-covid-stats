# Covid-19 Statistics API

I recently came across a really useful website called CollectApi. CollectApi is a platform where you can browse many different APIs as well as connect, share and more. 

https://collectapi.com/

You will need to create an account in order to generate an API token for use with the various APIs. There is currently 4 package types:

- Free
- Basic
- Premium
- Enterprise

I chose to use the free account which does have some restrictions on the number of requests you can make, but is more than enough for my needs.

Whilst browsing the list of APIs I came across the Covid-19 Statistics API. This API provides a wealth of information about the Covid-19 pandemic. The API provides information such as:

Service that gets the effects of the COVID-19 virus worldwide, and the data of the World Health Organization (WHO) in general and in detail.
